### The language that i used was C++
#### The main reason that i used C++ for my High Low game is because Firstly it is the language that i have the most experience in so i felt the most confident using it. Secondly it upports functions of high level programming languages, such as scripting for software applications. C++ can be used for many differnet things so growing my knowleadge now with basic code in the langauge will help me later on down the road.



### The IDE That i Used Was Repl.it
