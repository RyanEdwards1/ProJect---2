### Required Language: C or C++
### Description:

### The language that i used was C++
#### The main reason that i used C++ for my High Low game is because Firstly it is the language that i have the most experience in so i felt the most confident using it. Secondly it upports functions of high level programming languages, such as scripting for software applications. C++ can be used for many differnet things so growing my knowleadge now with basic code in the langauge will help me later on down the road.

### The IDE That i Used Was Repl.it
#### Repl.it is a online IDE that has a live preview of the outcome of the code that i have written so i an see any errors in present time and it also helps with this high low game because the game needs a input to continue so i can also enter that to find any errors or to complete the game in live time. 
#### It also saves your code to the cloud so you can access it at any time and you can also save it to your PC or GitHub aswell. 

### Implementation Of An Algorithm

### Debugging Process
#### With the help of the live view on Repl.it i managed to debug my code while i was doing line by line so that if i ran into any problems i was able to quickly fix them. One Example of a Error i had was i forgot to end a line of code with ';' and i didnt no what the problem was but i knew it was in my latest line of code as i had just typed it and by looking over my previous lines of code i saw the error quickly.

### Evaluation 
#### Overall the second project went alot better than the first project but i still had alot of problems with errors but with the debugging system in Repl.it i managed to get the program working in the end. It was my first time using a web based IDE. I liked using Repl.it alot as it had a live preview of your code on the right hand side and it would also tell you where the error has occurred which helped alot with the debugging of the code. I think that overall my game has met all the standerds set out from the start and has ticked all the boxes. It was also complete on time
